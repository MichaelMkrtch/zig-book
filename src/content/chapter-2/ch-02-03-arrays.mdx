# Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data type for grouping multiple values of the same type together.

## Creating Arrays
You can create arrays using syntax similar to languages like C and Go. You must specify the array's length (number of elements) and the data type of its elements. The length is part of the array's type.

```zig
const nums = [6]u8{4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
```

This creates a stack-allocated array of six 8-bit integers. The array type is `[6]u8`.

We can also let the Zig compiler figure out the number of elements in an array. This is done with the special `_` keyword.

```zig
const temps = [_]f32{68.0, 56.4, 98.5};
```

The compiler will infer the `temps` array type as `[3]f32`.


Crucially, arrays in Zig have a **fized size** determined at compile time. They are static. This is because the array's size dictates the amount of memory allocated for it, and this allocation happens when the program is compiled (or when the stack frame is created for local variables).

## Selecting Elements
Zig arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

### Accessing Single Elements
You can access individual elements using square brackets with the desired index (`[index]`). The type you get back will be the type of the element, which is `f32` in the below example.

```zig
const temps = [_]f32{68.0, 56.4, 98.5};

const first = temps[0];
```

You can get the last index of an array by using its length:

```zig
const last = temps[temps.len - 1];
```

Accessing an index outside the bounds of the array (like `temps[3]`) results in different behavior depending on your build mode. It is **undefined behavior** in `ReleaseSmall` and `ReleaseFast`, which can lead to crashes or incorrect results. In `Debug` and `ReleaseSafe` modes, it will typically trigger a panic.


### Creating Slices
You can create a slice that refers to a portion (or all) of an array using the `[start..end]` syntax, where `end` is exclusive. A slice stores its own length and a pointer to the start of its sequence. We will discuss more about slices in the following section.

```zig
const nums = [6]u8{4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};

const slice = nums[1..4];
```

`slice` is `[]u8{8, 15, 16}` and has a type of `[]u8`, meaning a slice of `u8`.

#### Shorthands For Slicing
* Omitting `end` will slice from `start` to the end of the original array:
  ```zig
  const slice_to_end = nums[2..]; // []u8{15, 16, 23, 42}
  ```
* Omitting `start` will slice from the beginning up to, but not including, `end`:
  ```zig
  const slice_from_start = nums[..3]; // []u8{4, 8, 15}
  ```
* You can also slice the entire array:
  ```zig
  const full_slice = nums[..]; // []u8{4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42}
  ```

## Slices
When you select a portion of an array using the `start..end` syntax, you are *slicing* the array.

A slice is a simple but powerful data structure, represented internally by two components:
* **Pointer** (`ptr`): A pointer to the first element the slice refers to.
* **Length** (`len`): A `usize` value indicating the number of elements in the slice.

```zig
const array = [_]u8{10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

const slice = array[1..4];
```

`slice` stores the slice `[]u8{20, 30, 40}`. Internally, it stores a pointer to the address of `array[1]`, where 20 is stored. It's length property is set to 3.

### Important Characteristics
Slices do not "own" the values they contain. They merely provide a *view* into a portion of the original array, meaning they do not own the underlying memory. If the slice was created from an array, modifying the slice *will modify the array*.

Additionally, the `len` field storing the slice length is a runtime value. It is crucial for iteration and bounds checking. When you access an element using `slice[index]`:
* In `Debug` and `ReleaseSafe` modes, a runtime check compares `index` against `len` to ensure it's within bounds (0 \<= index < len). Accessing an out-of-bounds index triggers a panic.
* In `ReleaseFast` and `ReleaseSmall` modes, these runtime checks are typically omitted for performance, making out-of-bounds access undefined behavior.
* The compiler can perform *compile time* bounds checks if both the index and length are known at compile time.

This example demonstrates accessing the runtime length:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();

    const temps = [_]f32{ 68.0, 56.4, 98.5, 22.3 };
    const slice = temps[1..];

    try stdout.print("slice length: {d}\n", .{slice.len});
}
```

### Slice Length: Compile Time vs Runtime
It's important to understand the difference between compile time and runtime, especially with arrays and slices.
  * Compile time is the phase when the Zig compiler analyzes your source code, checks types, resolves `comptime` values, and generates the executable program. Values known at compile time are fixed constants embedded within the program *before* it runs.
  * Runtime is the phase when the compiled program is actually executed on the computer. Values determined or changed during runtime can depend on things like the program's flow, user input, or calculations.

Array lengths are compile-time values because they are either explicitly defined or computed by the compiler. They are part of the array type, such as `[5]u8`.

Slice lengths, on the other hand, are typically runtime values. This is because slices frequently refer to portions of data whose size isn't fixed until code execution. Consider this example:

```zig
fn create_slice(arr: [4]u8, count: usize) []u8 {
    var slice = arr[0..count];
    return slice;
}
```

The slice length will not be known at compile time because it depends on `count`, a variable whose value will be determined when `create_slice()` is called. Until it's called, there is no way for the compiler to know the value of `count` so it is unable to determine the length of `slice`.

Slice lengths *can* be known at compile time in specific cases, such as when slicing with constant indices or when using Zig's `comptime` keyword. If you slice an array (or another compile-time known data structure) using indices that are constants known at compile time, the resulting slice's length is also known at compile time.

```zig
const arr = [4]u8{5, 10, 15, 20}; // arr.len = 4 (compile time)
const start_index = 1;            // Constant
const end_index = 4;              // Constant

// Both array and indices are compile-time known
const slice = arr[start_index..end_index]; // []u8{10, 15, 20}
```

During compilation, the compiler calculates `slice.len = end_index - start_index` (4 - 1 = 3).

If the slice itself, or the values used to create it (like the start/end indices), are explicitly evaluated at compile time using the `comptime` keyword, the length will be known then.

```zig
const arr = [_]u8{5, 10, 15, 20};
comptime var end_idx: usize = 3;
const slice = arr[0..end_idx]; // Evaluated at compile time
                               // slice.len = 3 - 0 = 3 (compile time)
```

We will explore Zig's powerful `comptime` feature in more detail later.

### Slice vs Array Pointers
We learned that you can always access the underlying pointer of a slice using `.ptr`. Assuming the slice isn't empty, you can always dereference this pointer with the `.*` operator to get the first element's value. The `.*` operator works on the pointer (`slice.ptr`) directly, not on the slice variable itself.

If, and only if, a slice's length `N` is known at compile time, Zig allows that slice to be implicitly converted (or explicitly cast) to a pointer to an array of that specific size `(*[N]T)`. You could then dereference it to get a copy of the array value or use the pointer to access the array's elements.

```zig
const array = [_]u8{10, 20, 30, 40};
// len (3) known at compile time
const comptime_len_slice = array[1..4];

// Implicit conversion to array pointer
var array_ptr: *[3]u8 = comptime_len_slice;

// You can use array_ptr as a pointer to an array of 3 elements
// Dereference to get array copy
const the_array_value: [3]u8 = array_ptr.*; // {20, 30, 40}

// Or access elements via the array pointer
const second_element = array_ptr[1]; // 30
```

If a slice's length is only known at runtime, this conversion to a fixed-size array pointer `(*[N]T)` is not possible because the compiler doesn't know what `N` should be. This is represented below with `?` and is not valid code.

```zig
fn process(runtime_slice: []u8) void {
    // ERROR: Cannot convert slice with runtime length to array pointer
    var array_ptr: *[?]u8 = runtime_slice;

    // Accessing .ptr is still fine
    if (runtime_slice.len > 0) {
        var first = runtime_slice.ptr.*;
        // ...
    }
}
```

In summary, slices with compile-time known lengths have the special ability to be treated as pointers to fixed-size arrays (`*[N]T`). Slices with runtime lengths do not.

## Array Operators
Zig provides operators for working with arrays, each with specific requirements for their operands. These requirements are detailed in the sections below. For more information, refer to Zigâ€™s official documentation.

### Concatenation (`++`)
The `++` operator creates a new array by joining the elements of two existing arrays. Both operand arrays must have lengths known at compile time.

```zig
const a = [_]u8{1, 2};
const b = [_]u8{3, 4, 5};
const c = a ++ b;

try stdout.print("{any}\n", .{c}); // { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
```

### Repetition (`**`)
The `**` operator creates a new array by repeating the elements of an existing array a specified number of times. The array operand must have a length known at compile time, and the repetition count must also be a compile-time known integer (typed `comptime_int`).

```zig
const a = [_]u8{1, 2};
const repeat_count = 2; // Compile-time known integer
const c = a ** repeat_count;

try stdout.print("{any}\n", .{c}); // { 1, 2, 1, 2 }
```

><span className="blockquote-header"><Info />Note: Runtime Operations</span>
These operators (`++`, `**`) do not work with slices where the length is only known at runtime. For runtime concatenation or repetition, you would typically use structures like `std.ArrayList` or manual memory allocation and copying. More on this later.

### Equality (`==`, `!=`)
If two arrays have the exact same type (`[N]T`), you can compare them for equality or inequality. Having the same type means they must have the same compile-time known length `N` and the same element type `T`.

```zig
const a = [_]u8{1, 2, 3}; // [3]u8
const b = [_]u8{1, 2, 3}; // [3]u8
const c = [_]u8{1, 2, 4}; // [3]u8
const d = [_]u8{1, 2};    // [2]u8

std.debug.print("a == b: {}\n", .{a == b}); // true
std.debug.print("a != c: {}\n", .{a != c}); // true

// Compile Error: type mismatch '[3]u8' != '[2]u8'
std.debug.print("a == d: {}\n", .{a == d});
```

### Assignment (`=`)
If two arrays have the exact same type (`[N]T`), you can assign one array to another. Assignment performs a copy of the entire array's contents from the right-hand side to the left-hand side.

```zig
var a = [_]u8{1, 2, 3};   // [3]u8
const b = [_]u8{4, 5, 6}; // [3]u8
const c = [_]u8{7, 8}; // [2]u8

a = b; // Copies contents of b into a
a = c; // Compile Error: type mismatch '[3]u8' != '[2]u8'

std.debug.print("a: {any}\n", .{a}); // a: { 4, 5, 6 }
```
