# Hello, World!

It's time to write your first Zig program!

## Creating a Project
We'll start by creating a directory to store the project. We suggest making a *projects* directory in your home directory, but you can make it anywhere you prefer.

Open your terminal. The following code will make a *projects* directory and a directory for the "Hello, world!" project within it.

```shell
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

## First Zig Program
Make a new file and name it *main.zig*. Zig files always end with the *.zig* extension. For multi-word filenames, the convention is to separate words with an underscore, like *hello_world.zig*.

Open *main.zig* in your favorite text editor and enter the code below:

```zig
pub fn test() !void {
    print("Fix this code");
}
```
