# The Zig Build System
For simple projects, compiling and executing can be combined using the `zig run` command:

```shell
$ zig run main.zig
```

This command compiles *main.zig* and immediately runs the resulting executable. While convenient, this approach doesn't scale well for projects with multiple files, dependencies, or complex build requirements.

## Package Management
For managing real-world projects, Zig provides a powerful integrated build system invoked via the `zig build` command. This eliminates the need for external build tools like CMake.

At the heart of the build system is the *build.zig* file, which should be located in your project's root directory. This is a regular Zig source file containing instructions written in Zig code that define how your project should be built (e.g., compiling source files, linking libraries, creating executables, running tests).

When you execute `zig build`, the Zig compiler looks for *build.zig* in the current directory. It then compiles and runs this *build.zig* script. The script, using the build system APIs provided by the standard library, orchestrates the compilation and linking of your entire project according to the logic you've defined.

When writing library functions, it is necessary to add `export` before function declarations so that they are available in the public library object created by the Zig compiler.

## Project Configuration and Dependencies
Alongside *build.zig*, you will often have a *build.zig.zon* file. The `.zon` extension stands for Zig Object Notation, a data format similar to JSON but designed for Zig. It primarily serves to:

* Declare metadata about your project (name, versions, etc.).
* Delcare dependencies you project needs from external sources.

The `build.zig.zon` file is similar to `package.json` in Node.js and `Cargo.toml` in Rust.

Zig has a package manager that is integrated with the build system. This package manager reads the dependency information from *build.zig.zon* and handles tasks like fetching and making them available to your *build.zig* script. Your *build.zig* script then uses functions like `b.dependency()` to incorporate these declared dependencies into the build process.

Zig's package manager is under active development and not as mature as Cargo in Rust. This means that it can change often and documentation can be out-of-date.

## Build Output
By default, the `zig build` command places compiled artifacts (executables, libraries) into a *zig-out* directory created in your project root. You can then run your executables directly, typically from:

```shell
$ ./zig-out/bin/your_project_name
# The project name will be the name you defined in build.zig
```
