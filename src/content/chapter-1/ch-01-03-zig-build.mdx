# The Zig Build System
For simple projects, compiling and executing can be combined using the `zig run` command:

```shell
$ zig run ./main.zig
```

This command compiles *main.zig* and immediately runs the resulting executable. While convenient, this approach doesn't scale well for projects with multiple files, dependencies, or complex build requirements.

## Creating a Project with Zig
We created the "Hello, world!" project manually by first making a directory then creating a *main.zig* file to store our code. Zig offers a better way to create projects through `zig init`. We first need to create a directory for the project, then run this command to have Zig set everything up for us. This is how we could have created the project in the previous section:

```shell
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
$ zig init
```

The `zig init` command creates the following project structure:

```text
hello_world
├─ src
│  ├─ main.zig
│  ├─ root.zig
├─ build.zig
├─ build.zig.zon
```

If you are writing an executable program such as our "Hello, world!" project, you will be writing code in *main.zig*. The convention is to delete the *root.zig* file. If you are writing a library, however, *root.zig* will be the root source file of the library. This means you can delete the *main.zig* file.

Both files are created with some boilerplate code. If you're curious, take a look at the code in the files. You can safely delete all of the code in either file and use the one necessary for your project (executable or library).

You may have noticed two files we have not yet discussed: *build.zig* and *build.zig.zon*. The following sections will explain their roles. The files contain helpful comments that explain the purpose of the code, so consider reading them if you're interested.

For now, **do not** delete the code in *build.zig* or *build.zig.zon;* otherwise, your projects will fail to build. If you are more experienced, feel free to modify the files.
* If you delete code in *build.zig*, the Zig compiler won't know what to compile or how to compile it.
* If you delete code in *build.zig.zon*, you will encounter errors because required fields in the file are missing.

With the project structure described above, we can no longer run our code with `zig run ./main.zig` because the *main.zig* is not in the project root. We have to use the correct path to the file: `zig run src/main.zig`.

## Package Management
For managing real-world projects, Zig provides a powerful integrated build system invoked via the `zig build` command. This eliminates the need for external build tools like CMake.

At the heart of the build system is the *build.zig* file, which should be located in your project's root directory. This is a regular Zig source file containing instructions written in Zig code that define how your project should be built (e.g., compiling source files, linking libraries, creating executables, running tests).

When you execute `zig build`, the Zig compiler looks for *build.zig* in the current directory. It then compiles and runs this *build.zig* script. The script, using the build system APIs provided by the standard library, orchestrates the compilation and linking of your entire project according to the logic you've defined.

><span className="blockquote-header"><Info />Note: Library Functions</span>
When writing library functions, it is necessary to add `export` before function declarations so that they are available in the public library object created by the Zig compiler.

## Project Configuration and Dependencies
Alongside *build.zig*, you will often have a *build.zig.zon* file. The `.zon` extension stands for Zig Object Notation, a data format similar to JSON but designed for Zig. It primarily serves to:

* Declare metadata about your project (name, versions, etc.).
* Delcare dependencies you project needs from external sources.

The `build.zig.zon` file is similar to `package.json` in Node.js and `Cargo.toml` in Rust.

Zig has a package manager that is integrated with the build system. This package manager reads the dependency information from *build.zig.zon* and handles tasks like fetching and making them available to your *build.zig* script. Your *build.zig* script then uses functions like `b.dependency()` to incorporate these declared dependencies into the build process.

Zig's package manager is under active development and not as mature as Cargo in Rust. This means that it can change often and documentation can be out-of-date.

## Build Output
By default, the `zig build` command places compiled artifacts (executables, libraries) into a *zig-out* directory created in your project root. You can then run your executables directly, typically from:

```shell
$ ./zig-out/bin/your_project_name
# The project name will be the name you defined in build.zig
```
